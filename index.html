            <h1>The Makertruck Project</h1>
            <p>
                The Mobile Makerspace
Initiative is a groundbreaking
portable STEAM education
platform that aims to transform
the learning landscape in
Aotearoa. By collaborating with
partner schools during year-long
residencies, we develop
ambitious, high-tech, and creative
engineering projects that challenge
students to acquire new skills and
implement them.
                
This initiative bridges the digital divide
by providing access to cutting-edge
technology and learning experiences for
students who may not have had the
opportunity otherwise.
                
By enhancing professional development for
teachers and fostering a culture of
innovation and curiosity, we pave the way for
future leaders and problem-solvers in
Aotearoa.
                
Our commitment to engaging the community
and ensuring equal access to STEAM education
guarantees the sustainability and success of the
project, ultimately shaping the next generation of
creative thinkers.
                
The model will be funded by a unique not for
profit/MOE partnership which will allow for
sustainable use of funding and a very productive use
of charity income
