            <h1>Projects</h1>
            <p>
                The Mobile Makerspace Initiative is a groundbreaking portable STEAM education platform that aims to transform the learning landscape in Aotearoa. By collaborating with partner schools during year-long residencies, we develop ambitious, high-tech, and creative engineering projects that challenge students to acquire new skills and implement them.
            </p>
            <p>
                This initiative bridges the digital divide by providing access to cutting-edge technology and learning experiences for students who may not have had the opportunity otherwise. By enhancing professional development for teachers and fostering a culture of innovation and curiosity, we pave the way for future leaders and problem-solvers in Aotearoa.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our commitment to engaging the community and ensuring equal access to STEAM education guarantees the sustainability and success of the project, ultimately shaping the next generation of creative thinkers.

            <h2>Creating a Vertical Garden with Automation and Interactive Statistic Interfaces</h2>
            <p>
                Students will design and construct a vertical garden, incorporating automated watering and feeding systems. They will also create interactive interfaces that track and display various statistics such as plant growth, water usage, and nutrient levels.
            </p>
            <img src="images/p1.jpg" alt="Project Image 2" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin-top: 20px;">
            <h2>Creating Kapa Haka Costumes with Neopixel LEDs</h2>
            <p>
                Students will design and create Kapa Haka costumes incorporating Neopixel LEDs. They will code these LEDs to create a light show that reflects the narrative (pÅ«rakau) of their performance.
            </p>
            <img src="images/p1.jpg" alt="Project Image 3" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin-top: 20px;">
            <h2>Re-imagining Instruments from across the Pacific</h2>
            <p>
                Students will research traditional Pacific instruments, then design, build, and play a new generation of these instruments, combining traditional elements with modern innovations.
            </p>
            <img src="images/p1.jpg" alt="Project Image 4" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin-top: 20px;">
            <h2>Motion Capture Sport Analysis Systems</h2>
            <p>
                Students will learn about and use motion capture technology to analyse sports performances. They will then use this analysis to develop models for performance improvement.
